        <description>this post is a work in progress (~50% done) &amp;amp; may not be completely factual
Notes on AVVideo Compression Recently I was tasked with fixing and adding new features to a video pipeline. Our app was supposed to record the user and save a compressed file to remote storage, however, our video files were getting corrupted. This post has some helpful information about Apple&amp;rsquo;s video encoding APIs. Not all information is 100% tested or factual - there is some speculation &amp;amp; I am not super knowledgable about this topic.</description>
