        <description>This document is from my work at ezpt.xyz, where I worked as an iOS developer on their physical therapy application. My hope is that this language becomes an industry standard, or at least a stepping-stone for the future of exercise notation.
Why are we creating EZEML? Workouts (aka Routines) on our app are constantly changing. Every time we modify what a workout looks like, we have to change our entire database schema.</description>
