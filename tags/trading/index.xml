        <description>HACKNC2022 A few weeks ago I had the chance to participate in HackNC 2022. I chose the financial track.
What I built Tempest is a manager for trading algorithms. Basically, it is an abstraction between the systems for placing orders on the exchange, and your trading algorithms. I made this because when I used to run trading bots, it was very annoying to manage them. With Tempest you can write trading algorithms in whatever language you want &amp;amp; not worry about how their signals get turned into trades.</description>
