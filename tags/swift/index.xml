        <description>this post is a work in progress (~50% done) &amp;amp; may not be completely factual
Notes on AVVideo Compression Recently I was tasked with fixing and adding new features to a video pipeline. Our app was supposed to record the user and save a compressed file to remote storage, however, our video files were getting corrupted. This post has some helpful information about Apple&amp;rsquo;s video encoding APIs. Not all information is 100% tested or factual - there is some speculation &amp;amp; I am not super knowledgable about this topic.</description>

        <title>EZPT Exercise Markup Language (EZEML)</title>
        <link>https://nathanbarta.com/posts/ezeml/</link>

        <description>This document is from my work at ezpt.xyz, where I worked as an iOS developer on their physical therapy application. My hope is that this language becomes an industry standard, or at least a stepping-stone for the future of exercise notation.
Why are we creating EZEML? Workouts (aka Routines) on our app are constantly changing. Every time we modify what a workout looks like, we have to change our entire database schema.</description>

        <description>All changes require minimal code changes and boost perfomance substantially. This is not a tutorial on how to use a map view.
Dequeue If you are looking at this blog, there is a high chance you already know the following optimization.
Map Views are set up very similary to Table Views from an interface perspective. Developers should make sure they dequeue MKMapAnnotations.
